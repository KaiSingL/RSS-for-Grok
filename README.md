# Patreon RSS

This is a quick hack to fetch the recent posts a creator made at Patreon.com.

Public (text) posts are available as full text, restricted posts only show the title.

This uses an unoffical API (the same that actually powers the Patreon website) and there are no guarantees that it won't break at some point.

This is in a very rough state but works good enough for me.

There's a proper composerized project at https://github.com/daemionfox/patreon-feed now, which you probably prefer.
